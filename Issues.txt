When creating users it won't create them with the first and last name.




fix when there is no overview for a movie to say so instead of blank space on the search results and watched "show" page.


fix the rows of the watched index page so the image and title are separate rows


fix issue where there is a nil error when "seen it" has been clicked but no checkboxes have been checked.


center the login page and make it bigger with a cool font and border and such, maybe a nice logo from illustrator?




add search to movies that you've seen.

add autocomplete of search to movies that are in the database.

change shading of an image when the mouse is over it.

number the search results maybe.

have the first search boxes be focussed when the pages load.

Make it prettier!
