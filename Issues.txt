When creating users it won't create them with the first and last name.



create show page for a watched movie with the bigger picture.


show message when you haven't watched any movies yet instead of empty table.

****set height of list of results and seen movies, and the width of the recently seen movies.

when there are no search results, don't show the table, put a string there.

fix the problem where you can go to the movie search page when there aren't any movies in the db yet.

fix issue where there is a nil error when "seen it" has been clicked but no checkboxes have been checked.

make the checkmark images take you to the show page for that movie you've seen.
----comments will go on the show page and can be edited.

center the login page and make it bigger with a cool font and border and such, maybe a nice logo from illustrator?




add search to movies that you've seen.

add autocomplete of search to movies that are in the database.

change shading of an image when the mouse is over it.

number the search results maybe.

have the first search boxes be focussed when the pages load.

Make it prettier!
